# 2D RRT Implementation in Unity
2D rapidly exploring random tree implemented in Unity 

One script randomly generates obstacles and places destination in the scene.

The RRT script then runs the RRT algorithm. 

Load Assets/scene in Unity 2017 to test.

Stepping through the algorithm can be controller through public booleans which will be visible in the inspector window under the RRT script.
